    <h2 style="color: red;">cell membrane, structure and functions</ h2 style="color: red>
    <p>plasma membrane, encloses contennts, semi-porous barrier. contains proteins and lipids. phospholipid bi layer, hydrophobic tails and philic heads. tails face inwards, heads outwards. also cholesterol, decreases permeability to water molecules</p>
    <p>also has integral and peripheral proteins. cilia made of microtubules, and stereocilia aids in absorption. e.g. ear. microvilli increase SA and basal infoldings</p>
    <h2 style="color: red>endoplasmic reticulum</h2 style="color: red>
    <p>accounts for 1/2 the cell membrane total. consists of tubules and cisternae. rough and smooth ER. rough has ribosomes on the surface. smooth synthesis lipids and detoxification</p>
    <h2 style="color: red>ribosomes and polyribisomes</h2 style="color: red>
    <p>responsible for protein synthesis. consists of 80 and 40S subunits. RNA comes from nucleolus. free spread through cytosol. nound attahced to RER. proteins from bound leave cell</p>
